<h1>Top rated movies</h1>
 <h2>My alltime favorites and why</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Police Academy</h3>
 <p>Very funny and sometimes a little riducles humor.<br />
    The jokes sometimes come at unexpected moments making it even more funny.</br />
    An alltime classic from the 90's that's even funny nowadays.</p>

 <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
 <p>Beautifull scenery, great actors and even better music.<br />
    Combined with a thrilling storyline that really sucks you in to the movie.<br />
    Could it BE any better?</p>

 <h3>Annabelle</h3>
 <p>Who doesn't like good horrormovie?<br />
    Annabelle sure does step up the game for this genre.<br />
    And the fact that it is based on real events makes it even more thrilling.<br />
    A must watch movie for all!</p>
