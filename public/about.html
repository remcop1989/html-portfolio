        <p>As of september 3rd 2024 I started Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp on 
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>. I've found it very interesting to code a program in Microsoft 
        Access with the use of VBA. This triggered me to explore more of this interesting puzzle that's called 
        coding and web development.</p>
        
        <p>Why not dive in to Access and VBA you might wonder?<br/>
        Well, Access and VBA both have their limitations. Next to that I think that webbased software is often 
        more practical in use than standalone. Last but not least I found that Angela's course covered all the 
        basics and would quickly show results. This would keep me motivated and thus able to finish the course. 
        Maybe in the future I'll also dive in to standalone software. But for now it's web development what 
        I'll be diving in to.</p>
        
        <p>Please feel free to roam around my website and see all the projects that I've managed to make with the 
        help of this course.</p>
