    <h2>My projects</h2>
        
    <h3>Movie ranking</h3>
        <p>The first project is to learn about different headers, tags and elements.<br/>
        Goal was to make a movie ranking website. Skills required in this were the use of the horizontal rule tag, line break tag and the paragraph tag. Next to this also different headers needed to be used.</p>
