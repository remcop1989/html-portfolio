    <h2>My projects</h2>
        
    <h3>Movie ranking</h3>
        <p>The first project is to learn about different headers, tags and elements.<br/>
        Goal was to make a movie ranking website. Skills required in this were the use of the horizontal rule tag, line break tag and the paragraph tag. Next to this also different headers needed to be used.</p>

    <h3>Color Vocab</h3>
        <p>It's time to start learning how to style a website using CSS.<br/>
        Therefor a website to learn colors in Spanish was made. Each color's name needed to be styled
        with the textcolor set to match the color's name.</p>

        <p>Diving deeper into CSS with (custom) fonts, the box-model, colours and inspecting CSS.

    <h3>Flag of Laos</h3>
        <p>Up until this point I knew CSS could do alot. But that you can make complete drawings with CSS, I didn't realize.
        This next assignment to test our skills learned so far, was to draw the flag of Laos. This one was fun and pretty challenging
        to do. Skills required where: working with selectors, combining selectors, positioning and the cascade (specificity, priority etc. that defines CSS).</p>

    <h3>Webdesign Agency website</h3>
        <p>Float, display, responsiveness and media queries where the 4 keywords of section 8 of the course. The final project for this
        section was pretty challenging. But we're there! A website for a webdesign agency. All elements where stacked on top of each other.
        Goal was to set them as they are now.</p>
