    <h2>My projects</h2>
        
    <h3>Movie ranking</h3>
        <p>The first project is to learn about different headers, tags and elements.<br/>
        Goal was to make a movie ranking website. Skills required in this were the use of the horizontal rule tag, line break tag and the paragraph tag. Next to this also different headers needed to be used.</p>

    <h3>Birthday invite</h3>
        <p>The second project was about making a website for a birthday invitation.<br/>
        The skills required to make this where extended with different kinds of lists, links and embedding images into your website.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio website</h3>
        <p>The third project is actually making this portfolio website.<br/>
        This project needed to be a multipage website and boilerplate on each page.</p>

    <h3>Color Vocab</h3>
        <p>It's time to start learning how to style a website using CSS.<br/>
        Therefor a website to learn colors in Spanish was made. Each color's name needed to be styled
        with the textcolor set to match the color's name.</p>

    <h3>Memes</h3>
        <p>Diving deeper into CSS with (custom) fonts, the box-model, colours and inspecting CSS.
        As a test, this meme-page was designed.</p>

    <h3>Flag of Laos</h3>
        <p>Up until this point I knew CSS could do alot. But that you can make complete drawings with CSS, I didn't realize.
        This next assignment to test our skills learned so far, was to draw the flag of Laos. This one was fun and pretty challenging
        to do. Skills required where: working with selectors, combining selectors, positioning and the cascade (specificity, priority etc. that defines CSS).</p>

    <h3>Webdesign Agency website</h3>
        <p>Float, display, responsiveness and media queries where the 4 keywords of section 8 of the course. The final project for this
        section was pretty challenging. But we're there! A website for a webdesign agency. All elements where stacked on top of each other.
        Goal was to set them as they are now.</p>

    <h3>Pricing table</h3>
        <p>Flexbox is what this project was all about. Pretty interesting to see what can be done and how this all comes
        together.</p>
        <figure>

    <h3>Flexbox layout</h3>
        <p>So continuouing on from the Pricing Table assignment I played around with flexbox a little and try to make
        the layout of a webpage with flexbox. This was pretty hard to do. But I got there. By the way: this was a self created
        "assigntment" outside of the Udemy course.</p>

    <h3>Mondrian painting</h3>
        <p>To test our knowledge and skills in grid the assingment was to recreate a Mondrian painting.
        The interesting part about this was to get flexbox and grid to work together to center the grid on page.
        That really showed the strengths and weaknesses of both grid and flexbox. After the flexbox layout assignment
        I created for myself I can definitely say that grid is more convenient in use as it comes to creating a layout.</p>
